# PyCraft
_Minecraft written in PyGame. Because why not._

## Usage
`python3 main.py`

## Controls
| Key  | Action |
|------|--------|
|`WASD`|Movement|
|Mouse |Rotate camera|
|`ESC` |Free/grab cursor|

## Notes
* It's slow. Such is the way of things with Python.
* Drawing could be sped up using Numpy vectorization, but drawing textured triangles with that would be rather difficult to figure out.
